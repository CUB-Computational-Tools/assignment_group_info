# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory group assignment. If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray!

## Preparation

You are strongly advised to complete the Git training first before tackling this assignment. This is a group assignment so everyone will be working on this exact same repository with you. **Think** before executing commands, but also - don't be afraid of making mistakes. If you run into trouble and can't figure out how to fix the problem, see if one of your peers can help you. If that doesn't do the trick, let us know what you've tried (but be aware that we may be equally flummoxed).

## Assignment

1. clone this repository to your Desktop
1. create a branch off of `master` with a descriptive name (ideally including your initials)
1. work in your branch! not on `master`
1. modify the [`group_info.md`](/group_info.md) to add your profile section (see template below)
1. push your changes back to GitHub (don't merge into master locally!)
1. on GitHub, file a new pull request to propose a merge of your branch into `base: master` and request reviews from three of your peers so they get notified    (see this not 100% applicable but still useful [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWMN5FxgdWI) 1:24+ if you're stuck)
1. make sure to resolve merge conflicts if there are any (the GitHub interface for this is quite good so you can do this online, see this also not 100% applicable but still useful [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2NjjQxFEuA) 9:00+ if you're stuck)
1. **DO NOT** merge your pull request until at least one your reviewers has given you the go ahead (reviewers: make sure to react to [pull request notifications](https://github.com/notifications?query=reason%3Areview-requested), take a look over the proposed merge and leave a quick comment)
1. once a reviewer has given you the go ahead, complete your merge (you might have to resolve additional merge conflicts if they have arisen from changes to the `master` branch in the meantime)
1. synchronize back with your desktop and check that the master branch has your updates

Happy branching!

## Template

`# Name`

> Add your name in a \# heading

`## 1. Main Programming Languages`

> What are the main programming languages (if any) that you currently use on a regular basis and what is your approximate level of mastery? (beginner = know my way around the language enough to write some basic code; intermediate = know a few tricks and can usually figure out how to solve a problem using language help/online resources; advanced = can write code fluently without needing to stop for help and am generally aware of the language's best practices; expert = understand how the language is structured at a fundamental level and have a very intuitive understanding for efficiently solving any problem I encounter)

`- Language1 (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)`

`- Language2 (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)`

`## 2. Course Goals`

> What goals would you like to accomplish through this class? This can be anything from things you'd like to know, skills you'd like to learn or improve, concepts you'd like to understand or apply, etc.

`1. `

`2. `

`3. `

`## 3. Something fun`

> Add a picture of yourself doing something you enjoy outside school (hiking, cooking, playing music, reading, etc) to the [`images`](images) folder and link to it here with a descriptive title (for mouseover). Make sure that images are not too big and in **jpeg/jpg** or **png** format. A width of 600 to maximally 1200 pixels is typically plenty large (i.e. less than **~2Mb**). You can scale your image to these dimensions using any photo editing software. For example, a convenient free online tool for scaling images is available [here](https://www168.lunapic.com/editor/?action=scale).

`## 4. ???`

> Include something of your own choosing not described above. Anything. Be creative!
